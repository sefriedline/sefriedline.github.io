In September 2020, Emily and I embarked on our third installment in the 10-year Pacific Crest Trail project. This year adaptability was the name of the game as we had to work around the intense fire season that hit California and Oregon. Our hike took us south through 181 miles of central Oregon from Santiam Pass (above the Three Sisters Wilderness) to the rim at Crater Lake. We learned to love the green tunnel, we reveled in the shadow and destruction of volcanoes, and we muscled through some of the driest days of hiking so far.
Some of the highlights included camping on our personal penninsua on crystal clear Summit Lake, summitting the knifes-edge of Mt. Thielsen, and surviving a wind storm in Crater Lake NP that had trees crashing down around us throughout the night. Unfortunately, we had to leave the trail five days early due to the worsening fire conditions but we still got in 12 beautiful wilderness days!
This brings our total PCT miles to 600 when counted with our John Muir Trail trek in 2018 and our Tuolumne Valley to Lake Tahoe trek in 2019. Only 2045 miles to go!
