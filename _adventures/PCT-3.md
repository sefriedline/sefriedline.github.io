organization: PCT Section Hike 3
---
<p style="margin-left: 3em;">
In September 2020, I had the opportunity to hike a third section of the Pacific Crest Trail. This year adaptability was the name of the game as we had to work around the intense fire season that hit California and Oregon. The hike took us south through 181 miles of central Oregon from Santiam Pass (above the Three Sisters Wilderness) to the rim at Crater Lake. I learned to love the green tunnel, reveled in the shadow and destruction of volcanoes, and muscled through some of the driest days of hiking so far.
Some of the highlights included camping on a personal peninsula on crystal clear Summit Lake, summiting the knife-edge of Mt. Thielsen, and surviving a wind storm in Crater Lake NP that had trees crashing down around us throughout the night. Unfortunately, we had to leave the trail five days early due to the worsening fire conditions but still got in 12 beautiful wilderness days!
This brings my total PCT miles to 600 when counted with my John Muir Trail trek in 2018 and Tuolumne Valley to Lake Tahoe trek in 2019. Only 2045 miles to go!
