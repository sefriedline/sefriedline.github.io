In the Spring of 2020 when my usual research was shut down due to the developing pandemic, I had the opportunity to help construct the Innovative Genomics Institute COVID-19 Testing Facility at UC Berkeley. This mad-dash project pulled a CLIA-complient diagnostic lab out of thin air in less than 2 months. My role in the operation was to integrate a custom-built laboratory information management system (LIMS) into the rapidly evolving assay workflow. I had the opportunity to work alongside some of UC Berkeley's finest including Shana McDevitt, Lisa Martell, Fyodor Uronov, Dirk Hockemeyer, and Jennifer Doudna. The experience was exhilerating, exhausting, and ultimately rewarding and I was proud to be part of an initiative that placed its focus on prioritizing the underserved communities of the East Bay.
