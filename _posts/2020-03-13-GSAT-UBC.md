I am moving to Canada! In January of 2021 I will begin the <A HREF = "https://www.gsat.ubc.ca/">Genome Science and Technology</A> Graduate Program at the University of British Columbia - Vancouver. I will begin my studies supported by a rotation scholarship and pursue a MSc degree for approximately 2 years. My ultimate goal is to continue on to the PhD program.

I hope to answer questions related to the cooperation observed in human-relavant microbial communities. A good example of this is the complex metabolism that we rely on to purify our wastewaters.

Graduate studies is something that never seemed like a reality to me but here I stand on the doorstep. I am humbled by the generosity and support that has filled my life and empowered me to do this. I am eager to take these next steps on my research adventure and want to briefly acknowledge a few people who have illuminated my path so far:

Emily <br>
Mom and Dad <br>
Carson <br>
Jake <br>
Kyle <br>
Adam <br>
Jack <br>
Patrick <br>
<br>

Thank you all immeasurably! I look forward to sharing more of this journey with you!
