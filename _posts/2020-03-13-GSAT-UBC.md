It is with much gratitude that I would like to announce I have accepted my offer of admission to the Genome Science and Technology Graduate Program at the University of British Columbia - Vancouver. I will begin my studies in Canada supported by a rotation scholarship in the Fall of 2020.

Graduate studies is something that never seemed like a reality to me but here I stand on the doorstep. I am humbled by the generosity and support that has filled my life and empowered me to do this.I am eager to take these next steps on my research adventure and want to briefly acknowledge a few people who have illuminated my path so far:

Emily <br>
Mom and Dad <br>
Carson <br>
Jake <br>
Kyle <br>
Adam <br>
Jack <br>
Patrick <br>
<br>

Thank you all immeasurably! I look forward to sharing more of this journey with you!
