My name is Skyler and I love biology. I began my biology career at my 5th birthday when I was given my first lab coat.


A few years after that, I attended the University of California, Santa Barbara where I earned my B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. As I had not yet discovered the beauty and quiet of a nice lab bench, I spent many of these days working as an EMT for a local ambulance company.

After my graduation and a hard look at a life in medicine, I entered the private biotech industry by reconnecting with a local Santa Barbara startup called Serimmune. This was an incredible introduction to the research and development life and I credit the mentorship I received here with launching my career in biology.

In a big step for my career and my family life, I moved the San Francisco Bay Area to pursue a different flavor of research. This led me to Adam Arkin's bioengineering lab at the University of California, Berkeley where I currently work as a research associate. Here, my love of sci-fi and my enthusiasm for microbiology collide on a project to engineer bacteria for serving the needs of astronauts as they travel to Mars. The mission, titled CUBES and funded by NASA, has boggled my mind and challenged my creativity, but most importantly impressed me with its ambition.

I intend to continue my trajectory of a career in biological research. My interest is always evolving and I love to learn new techniques but a few pillars have started to form that I would like to build my research around.

1) Environmental stewardship - especially the remediation and recycling of our many, many wastes

2) Community ecology - particularly the enigmatic networks of microbes that underlie all native and built environments

3) Universal access - the bounty of science belongs to everyone and I am committed to solutions that are available to all
