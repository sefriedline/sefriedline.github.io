The GSAT program at UBC is an interdisciplinary graduate opportunity to explore any facet of how genomics can change our world. I intend to investigate microbial cooperation. To me, this means two things. How to microbes interact with each other to achieve stasis and community survival? How can we work with the natural talents of microbes to achieve our own goals such as waste remediation and resource recovery. I am currently a rotation student.
