Microbial communities are at work all over the world at this moment treating the many human waste streams. Treatment of wastewater was one of the first applications of microbial ecology on an industrial scale and continues to be one of our best sources for studying complex food-webs in a semi-controlled setting. My personal interest in this field is in translating our maturing understanding of the processes at play into solutions that require less technology and monitoring to apply. I think preserving our wild lands is of paramount importance to our survival on this planet and making treatment of waste an accessible and socially-imperative option is one of the many steps that will enable this goal.
