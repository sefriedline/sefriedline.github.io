I am intrigued by the complicated emergent properties of systems composed of "simple" elements.
Minds in this field explore everything from ant colonies to economics and use models of such systems to explore even more abstract space. <br>
The corner of this broad field that I am most keen on is the network formed between genes, microbes, and the environment. I think there is much to be learned from agent-based and/or formulaic modeling of these interactions.
