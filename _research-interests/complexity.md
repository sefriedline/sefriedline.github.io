I am intrigued by the incredible, emergent properties of systems composed of "simple" elements.
Minds in this field explore everything from the behavior of ant colonys and human cities to the apparation of thoughts from neurons.
The application that I am most keen on is the interaction networks between genes and the environment. Especially genes within a community of micro-organisms.
